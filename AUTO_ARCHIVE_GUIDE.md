# Auto-Archive Ticket System

## üìã Overview

The Discord bot now includes an **automatic ticket archiving system** that saves all ticket data to local storage when tickets are closed. This ensures that no ticket information is lost and provides easy access to historical ticket data.

## üîß Features

### ‚úÖ Auto-Archive on Close
- **Automatic Archiving**: When any ticket is closed using `/closeticket` or the ticket close commands, it automatically gets archived to local storage
- **Direct to Archive**: Tickets are moved directly from "Active" to "Archive" category and stored in the archived tickets database
- **Comprehensive Data**: All ticket information including creator, creation time, close time, and type is preserved

### üìÅ Local Storage Integration
- **Persistent Storage**: All archived tickets are saved to `data/tickets.json` under the `archived_tickets` section
- **Real-time Updates**: Storage is updated immediately when tickets are archived
- **Data Structure**: Each archived ticket includes:
  - Creator ID and tag
  - Channel name and ID
  - Ticket type (general, order, cs)
  - Creation timestamp
  - Archive timestamp
  - Who archived it
  - Whether it was auto-archived or manually archived

### üñ•Ô∏è Archive Management Commands
- **`/viewarchive all`**: View all archived tickets
- **`/viewarchive user <user>`**: View archived tickets for a specific user
- **`/viewarchive stats`**: View comprehensive archive statistics

## üöÄ How It Works

### Automatic Process
1. User runs `/closeticket` or ticket close command
2. Bot immediately moves ticket to archive category
3. Channel is renamed with "archived-" prefix
4. Ticket data is saved to local storage with archive information
5. User permissions are updated (no send messages)
6. Confirmation embed is sent showing archive details

### Data Storage Structure
```json
{
  "archived_tickets": {
    "channel_id": {
      "creator_id": "user_id",
      "creator_tag": "username#1234",
      "channel_name": "ticket-username-1234",
      "category": "active",
      "type": "general",
      "created_at": "2025-09-16T12:00:00.000Z",
      "closed_at": "2025-09-16T13:00:00.000Z",
      "closed_by": "admin_user_id",
      "archived_at": "2025-09-16T13:00:00.000Z",
      "archived_by": "admin_user_id",
      "auto_archived": true
    }
  }
}
```

## üîí Permission Requirements
- Archive viewing commands require **Administrator** permissions
- Only admins/owners can use `/viewarchive` commands
- Regular users can still close their own tickets (which auto-archives)

## üíæ Technical Details

### Storage Location
- File: `data/tickets.json`
- Section: `archived_tickets`
- Format: JSON with UTF-8 encoding

### Backup Considerations
- Archive data is included in all data backup operations
- Archived tickets persist through bot restarts
- Can be exported/imported with other bot data

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### Existing Tickets
- Tickets that were closed before this update remain in `closed_tickets`
- New tickets closed after the update go directly to `archived_tickets`
- Manual archiving still available for moving old closed tickets to archive

### Storage Transition
- The system maintains backward compatibility
- Both `closed_tickets` and `archived_tickets` are supported
- Archive commands can view both categories as needed
